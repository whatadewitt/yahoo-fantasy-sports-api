Yahoo! Fantasy API Node Module
======

This is a node module created to wrap the Yahoo! Fantasy Sports API ([link](https://developer.yahoo.com/fantasysports/guide/index.html)). At the moment, not all subresources are available, nor are any of the 'collection' elements. I do hope to add them, and they have been added to the code, but as of now this project is very much in an open beta phase.

The API is designed to act as a helper for those interacting with the Y! Fantasy API. The goal is for ease of use for the user, both in terms of querying endpoints and parsing responses. I've noticed that in working with the API, the data is not always the easiest to understand, so hopefully what I have created here will help people out.

Installation
-------
You can install the module via npm by running:

    $ npm install yahoo-fantasy

Usage Note
-------
I've created a customized version of the [Passport Strategy for Yahoo! OAuth](https://github.com/whatadewitt/passport-yahoo-oauth) to help me when I developed this module. It's a fork of the strategy on the PassportJS homepage, which simply fixed a couple of issues. It would appear that the original creator is no longer supporting the strategy, and I may have missed some things, but it has worked as much as I've needed it. Please let me know if you have any questions about it.

Licence
-------
This module is available under the [MIT Licence](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

Documentation
-------
More complete documentation can be found using the application sandbox. This sandbox is also a work in progress, but it is my hope going forward to complete it.

The API can be used by simply importing the module and querying data

    var YahooFantasy = require('yahoo-fantasy');
    // you can get an application key/secret by creating a new application on Yahoo!
    var yf = new YahooFantasy(
      Y!APPLICATION_KEY,
      Y!APPLICATION_SECRET
    );

    // if a user has logged in (not required for all endpoints)
    yf.setUserToken(
      Y!CLIENT_TOKEN,
      Y!CLIENT_SECRET
    );

    // query a resource/subresource
    yf.{resource}.{subresource} (
      {possible argument(s)},
      function cb(err, data) {
        // handle error
        // callback function
        // do your thing
      }
    );

Bugs & Issues
-------
This project is very much still a work in progress, please report any issues via the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yfsapi/issues).

Changelog
-------

#### 2.0.1
  * Removed the code that added a "reason" to errors coming from Yahoo! as it was breaking other errors. Retry notifications should now be handled within the application using the module.

#### 2.0.0
  * Moved to Yahoo!'s OAuth2.0 authentication mechanism. 

#### 1.0.2
  * Fixed game resource roster postions callback bug.

#### 1.0.0
  * Breaking changes
  * Fixed NFL scoreboard/matchups bug ([Issue #19](https://github.com/whatadewitt/yfsapi/issues/19))
  * In fixing this bug I realized that my "team" set up was really only useful for MLB fantasy, so I rewrote team mapping to work better across all sports and give additional details that weren't previously reported. This will cause errors if you are using the team.manager attribute in your code.
